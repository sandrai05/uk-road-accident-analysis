# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (2021–2022)

This project shows a Power BI dashboard I built to analyze road accident data in the UK for the years 2021 and 2022.

## 📌Project Goal
The goal was to give stakeholders a visual report showing:

- Total road accidents and casualties
- How severe the accidents were (fatal, serious, slight)
- Where and when these accidents happened
- What types of vehicles were involved
- Differences between 2021 and 2022

## 🧩My Role
I worked on the full dashboard from start to finish:

- Cleaned and prepared the raw data
- Chose what KPIs to show based on requirements
- Created DAX measures and visuals in Power BI
- Designed the layout to make insights easy to find

## 📊Key Insights from the Dashboard
